# advent of code

https://adventofcode.com/

2020 was my first year participating. I'll probably go back through and try to solve all
the old years, and start participating every December. Right now I'm using javascript
to solve the exercises, but maybe I'll incorporate some other languages at some point
(or try to learn some new languages ðŸ¤·).
