# advent of code 2020

https://adventofcode.com/2020/

this repo contains my solutions for advent of code 2020. it's my first time particpating,
so my solutions are just going to be quick/ugly (and probably all in javascript). next year
i might try getting a little more creative and spending a little more time on this :shrug:
